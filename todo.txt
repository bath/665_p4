1) change main.cpp to stuff on piazza, talk with chris?
2) types and error checking stuff ... need to read through project details more thoroughly
    three main error types
        More than one declaration of an identifier in a given scope	  -- isInCurrentScope & lookUp
            when declaring an id, ensure it doesn't already exist
        Use of an undeclared identifier	 -- isInCurrentScope & lookUp
            when using an id, ensure that it does exist
        Bad declaration type (variable or parameter of void type)
            when declaring an id, ensure it has a proper type  
                possible types: 
                    int intptr bool boolptr char charptr
                    void if else while return true false
                    FROMCONSOLE TOCONSOLE NULLPTR
                    varDecl:
                        int, inptr, bool, boolptr, char, charptr
                    fnDecl:
                        int, inptr, bool, boolptr, char, charptr, void
